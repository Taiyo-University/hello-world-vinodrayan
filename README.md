# 🚀 Getting Started
Our goal for this very first assignment is to learn the assignment submission flow using GitHub Classroom!

1) Fix the code in hello.js
2) Submit your change in one of two ways (or try both):
   1) Click on the sync button next to the assignment name
   2) Open the VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl-Shift-P), select `GitHub Classroom: Sync Changes`, and press Enter.
3) That's it - you should get an email with a link to a Pull Request (PR) within a few minutes.
